                    Nothing in this website is an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any tokens. Solana is publishing this website solely to receive feedback and comments from the public. If and when
                    Solana offers for sale any tokens (or a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), it will do so through definitive offering documents, including a disclosure document and risk factors. Those definitive
                    documents also are expected to include an updated version of this website, which may differ significantly from the current version. If and when Solana makes such an offering in the United States,
                    the offering likely will be available solely to accredited investors.
